\section{Appendix}

Information gained during the interview.

\begin{itemize}

	\item Each tram has two carriges each having a capacity of 210 people.
	
	\item The average dwell time in seconds of a tram is calculated by the 
	following formula:
	
	  \begin{equation}
	    \label{eq:eq1}
	    \{ d = 12,5 + 0,22 peopleIn + 0.13 peopleOut \}.
	  \end{equation}
	
	\item An alternative model is:
	  \begin{equation}
	    \label{eq:eq1}
	    \{ d = (2.3 * 10 ^ -5) * (peopleTransfer ^ 2) * (peopleIn + peopleOut) \}.
	  \end{equation}
	
	\item If a tram is occupying a station all trams traveling to that station 
	have to wait.
	
	\item Waiting times are generated using the Gama's distribution.
	
	\item Trams at head stations have a turnaround time of 40 sec. 
	All other trams at that station will have to wait for the turning tram.
	
	\item The minimum departure times between trams leaving the same station is 40 sec.
	
	\item Turning a tram around takes 3 min.
	
	\item In the morning it is expected that each station gets visited by 4 trams a hour.Later that day this number will be increased to 16 per hour.
	
	\item Trams park at P\&R
