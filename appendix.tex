\section{Appendix}

Information gained during the interview.

Each tram has two carriges each having a capacity of 210 people.

The average dwell time in seconds of a tram is calculated by the following formula:

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:eq1}
    \{ d = 12,5 + 0,22 peopleIn + 0.13 peopleOut \}.
  \end{equation}

An alternative model is:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:eq1}
    \{ d = (2.3 * 10 ^ -5) * (peopleTransfer ^ 2) * (peopleIn + peopleOut) \}.
  \end{equation}

If a tram is occupying a station all trams traveling to that station have to wait.

Waiting times are generated using the Gama's distrobution.

Trams at head stations have a turnaround time of 40 sec. 
All other trams at that station will have to wait for the turning tram.

The minimum departure times between trams leaving the same station is 40 sec.

Turning a tram around takes 3 min.

In the morning it is expected that each station gets visited by 4 trams a hour.
Later that day this number will be increased to 16 per hour.

Trams park at P\&R
